                The big idea: While extensive work has been done on using LLMs to generate items for psychological tests, no one has taken the crucial next step of integrating LLMs directly into the assessment process itself. Current AI applications in mental health focus heavily on AI therapy and chatbots—an oversaturated market—but miss the fundamental need for accurate, adaptive psychological assessments with clinical validity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach addresses this critical gap by embedding LLMs into the testing experience to enable real-time, personalized question selection based on individual response patterns. Instead of static, one-size-fits-all assessments, we create dynamic evaluations that adapt intelligently to each user, improving both accuracy and engagement. This means more precise clinical insights, reduced assessment fatigue, and better outcomes for both practitioners and patients.
            </p>
            <p>
                We see this as a significant market opportunity: the psychometric assessment space is ripe for innovation, yet remains largely untouched by modern AI capabilities. While others chase the crowded AI therapy market, we're building the foundation that makes all mental health interventions more effective—accurate, personalized psychological assessment powered by adaptive AI.
