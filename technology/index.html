            <h3>The Innovation</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                While significant research has focused on using large language models to generate psychological test items, we've taken the crucial next step: integrating LLMs directly into the assessment process itself. Current AI applications in mental health concentrate heavily on therapy chatbots and conversational interfaces—an increasingly saturated market. However, this focus overlooks a fundamental need: accurate, adaptive psychological assessments with clinical validity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                We address this critical gap by embedding advanced language models into the testing experience, enabling real-time, personalized question selection based on individual response patterns.
