      title: "Dynamic Psychometrics"
      intro: "Entrelacs uses dynamic psychometrics to capture how thoughts, emotions, and behaviors interact over time, revealing each person’s unique mental health fingerprint beyond what static questionnaires can show."
      usage_text: "Entrelacs creates a personalized dynamic network model that maps how an individual’s symptoms interact over time. It learns each person’s stable patterns and early warning shifts, even before symptoms become clinical. With every new interaction, the model becomes more accurate, detecting cascades like sleep issues → anxiety → withdrawal early for timely intervention."
      advantage_text: "Traditional assessments capture snapshots; Entrelacs captures motion. This dynamic approach transforms assessment from reactive to preventive, enabling clinicians and organizations to act before crises emerge, tailor interventions to personal patterns, and measure progress with unprecedented precision."

      usage_text: "When individuals opt in, Entrelacs analyzes behavioral and conversational data together. Time-series patterns, like activity shifts, social engagement changes, routine disruptions, and sleep irregularities, are detected early.
